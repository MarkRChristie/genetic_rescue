#== Next steps ===================================================================================#

paramters that work well:
Nadults=30, semelparity off, max.age=5, max.juvenile.age=1




1. add in semelparity as a toggle; track population dynamics
2. once semelparity is working, toggle in demographic stochasticity
3. tweak extinction vortex


Log:
1. added minor stabilizing selection back in
  - try k.adults = 100 next
  - works but some fine tuning needed (prevents extinction)







[x] change shape of fitness function for selection to parabola centered around 0

[x] start and finish process of extinction vortex
[x] need to maintain small populations for a while
[x] measure fis and ne through time



[x] clean up selection strength and fitness functions (is now a conditional variable)
[] figure out life history variables to vary
  [] vary them in both donor and source


#== sublime text commands ======================================================================#
steps:
1. open project
2. open files with double click to get new tab
3. ctrl + 1; "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.1/bin/R.exe"
4. ctrl + 2; wsl


edited key map so that:
ctrl + 1 opens 1 terminal
ctrl + 2 oopens a second terminal

alt+# to switch tabs




#== at some point ================================================================================#
[] check that varying environmental contribution slows down evolution
[] check (again) that reproduction is working as intended (check a parent and offspring)


# completed ===========================#

[x] add neutral loci
[x] add environmental contribution to phenotype

[x] automate process for both ne and local adapation creaion
[x] finish process of creating divergent process
[x] 50 year burnin
[x] 100 year selection
[x] 100 year to NE
[x] 200 years, 100 years for evolution followed by 100 years for NE
[x] save output of creating populations along NE and local adapation gradient
[x] set Nes of source populations
[x] set local adaptation of source populations 
[x] save pops for later simulations
[x] automate process for ne creation of 3 pops
[x] automate process for ne creation of 3 local adaptations
